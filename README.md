# ðŸ“˜ MIPS Assembly Practice

This repository contains a collection of small MIPS assembly programs written and tested in [MARS](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/mars-mips-simulator.htm.)

Each program demonstrates a fundamental concept of the MIPS instruction set: registers, memory, syscalls, arithmetic, branching, procedures, stack usage, and more.

The goal of this repo is to:
1. Serve as a study resource for exams/quizes in college.
2. Act as a reference for learning low-level programming

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install [MARS MIPS Simulator](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/mars-mips-simulator.htm.)
2. Clone this repo:
  `git clone https://github.com/VladAnton22/mips-exercises.git
   cd mips-exercises`
3. Open any .asm file in MARS
4. Assemble and Run
