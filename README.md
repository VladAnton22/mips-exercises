# ðŸ“˜ MIPS Assembly Practice

This repository contains a collection of small MIPS assembly programs written and tested in [MARS](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/mars-mips-simulator.htm.)

Each program demonstrates a fundamental concept of the MIPS instruction set: registers, memory, syscalls, arithmetic, branching, procedures, stack usage, and more.

The goal of this repo is to:
